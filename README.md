# Dota 2 Comedic Stats Parser

A DotA2 Website/App that provides the user with comedic statistics regaurding his/her personal 
statistics compared to that of DotA2 Pro Players. 

## Basic Usage

The user interface must be simple and intuitive and have a single responsiblity role of sorts.

The user will have an area to enter their steam Username or Steam32ID upon which 
entering will display graphical statistics comparing their gameplay statistics to that of 
popular DotA2 Professional Players. 

The user should also be provided an option to filter the results, such as 
choose what Pro Player they wish to compare themselves to paired with what 
stats to compare. 

## Development

OpenDota has provided an excellent documented API for us to use and all data needed
will be pulled from their service. 

* [OpenDota API](https://docs.opendota.com/#section/Introduction)

Be mindful of your requests, as stated in their documentation try to keep requests to 3/s. 
Hosting servers is not cheap so lets respect what they are doing for the community by doing
our part. 

Another Development goal here should be not to reinvent the wheel. If there is a
Framework or Library that accomplishes a task and makes life easier you are encouraged 
to use it. Just be wary of overuse and build your own solution when necessary or you see fit. 


## Code Review

When commiting to the repository your code will be tested and reviewed by a professsionl 
developer who will offer suggestions or fixes to your code. While learning is 100% the goal 
of this project, we also need a working product in the end.

Anyone and Everyone is encouraged to commit! This is a learning proecess for people 
and a great way to boost your development skills while having the ability to proove it
to potential employers! 

## Security 

Lets be mindful and program with a secure mindset. It's our responsibility to protect the user's data.
